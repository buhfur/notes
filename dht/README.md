# What makes up a distributed hash table ? 

Hashing 
---

done through hash "functions" 

An event When a hash function produces the same key for two different sets of data,
is considered a collision. 

One way to deal with a collision is to put the values in a linked list . 
Common examples of hash functions : 
  - SHA256 
Summary : 
  - turn values into numerical values that correlate to data 
  - these functions produce "hashes" 
  - some are better than others
  - possible to run out of hashes 



# Goals for today ( Date : 05-24-2022 ) 
- [] create a hash table in go-lang from a hash table implementation in C 
- [] push
